            Traveling is my number one interest because I love experiencing new places and learning new cultures. Every time I travel somewhere new I feel like I can learn something from at least one experience on that trip and how it shapes who I am today.

            Another reason why I love traveling so much is because it brings me peace and joy. It brings me out of my comfort zone and helps me grow as a person. Whether it's trying new food, or adopting to new ways, and navigating through a new city,  I always learn something valuable.
