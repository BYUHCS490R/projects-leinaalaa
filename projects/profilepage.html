    <h1>All About Leina'ala Akaka</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Aloha I'm born and raised on the island of Kaua'i and I've lived there my whole life. This is my first year but second semester here at BYU-Hawai'i. I am studying in Information Technology and minoring in HTM and Hawaiian Studies. </p>
    <p>When I'm not busy with classes I go to work at Kumuwaiwai Center for Sustainability. I like working at the garden because I can leave my stress and problems behind and feel peace and connect with nature in the garden. Another thing that I like to do in my free time is drawing while listening to music. </p>
